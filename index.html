                Lucy McGuigan believes in the power of design as a conduit for communicating the complex ideas that drive us. Originally
                from New Jersey, she now lives and works in Dallas, TX. Lucy received a Master of Arts in Art History from
                Southern Methodist University in 2016. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of
                Pennsylvania in 2011.<p>
                <p id = "topspace"> With a professional background that has spanned from teaching high school math to grant writing for a nonprofit
                community design center—and many other roles in between—she is excited to bring her diverse frames of reference
                to the task of building beautiful, functional websites.
